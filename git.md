* [Git Tutorial: A Comprehensive Guide](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/#2_1)

Git was created by Linus Toralds, the creator of Linux.

Git is a "distributed version control system" that creates "snapshots" of changes made to your project.  

A changed version of your project is called a **commit**. 

Git allows developers to collaborate with each other on a project from multiple workflows.

Git tracks every change applied to files & directories, minimizing risk of loss or corruption to files.

## Git Flow

### Repository Structure
Your local Git Repository has three components. 
 1. Working Directory: This is where your files are, and where you make your changes. 
 2. Index: This is the staging area. Where your changed version goes when you add it to be committed. 
 3. Head: This is your remote directory where your changed files go once they have been saved/committed. 

### File States
This is the "life cycle" of your file. 
 1. Modified - Git has noted that the file has changed in working directory, but not committed (saved). 
 2. Staged - Changed version has been flagged as "to be committed", it is now in the staging area.  
 3. Committed - File data has been securely stored in database/repository.  

### ACP 
These are the steps to move your files between file states.
 1. Add - Move changed version into the staging area. 
 2. Commit - Creates the official snapshot of your changes.
 3. Push - Feeds your snapshot through to your remote repository.
