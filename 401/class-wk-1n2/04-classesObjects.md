## Object-Oriented Programming

* **What is Object Oriented Programming?**
  * I'm going to describe an object for a problem that I'm solving.
  * Object oriented programming is mimicking real world objects in code.

Everything in C# is essentially a class, and we can instantiate objects from classes that we can manage at a smaller level.

All code in C# lives in a ***Class*** of some sort.

## Classes

* We've seen them, now how do we use them?
  * A class is a blueprint for a specific type or category of object. This means that the class will outline what exactly each object will have in regards to properties, methods, and general behavior.

## Objects

* What is the difference between a class and an object??
  * An object is an instance of a class
  * To create an object, we must instantiate it from a non-abstract class.

## Constructors

Constructors are created by default with each class.

They are the "requirements" of what information is required before an object can be instantiated.

We have the ability to add more than one constructor if needed. By default, we get an "empty" one.

If we decide to create a new constructor, we must explicitly declare an empty constructor for it to be used.

## Object Initializers

We can initialize an object on creation. This saves space when coding, and sometimes looks a little cleaner.

## Keyword Static

* What does static mean?
  * If it is marked as static, it lives at the class level, not the object level.
  * This means it applies to all of the objects within that class.
  * (ie) all **Book** *objects* within *class* **Book** have static property of **Belongs to Misti Dinzy**.

✨ Good practice: Property & Method names should always start with a capital. ✨
