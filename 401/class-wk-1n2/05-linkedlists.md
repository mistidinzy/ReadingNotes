## Traversing through a Linked List

Linked lists **can't** do **Random Access Memory**

## MOST IMPORTANT ABOUT LINKED LISTS

‚≠êÔ∏è THE BEST WAY TO MOVE THROUGH A LINKED LIST. ‚≠êÔ∏è

‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è current = current.next; ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è

‚≠êÔ∏è Instead of foreach or for loops, the best way to move through a Linked List is with a **while** loop. (ie. While ***current*** is NOT *null* {xyz}). ‚≠êÔ∏è

‚≠êÔ∏è Equivalent of **i++** with linked list is **Current = Current.Next** ‚≠êÔ∏è

```C#

public 

```

## Linked List - Traversal - Big O

The Big O of ***time*** for **Includes** would be **O(n)**.

This is because, at its worse case, the node we are looking for will be the very last node in the linked list.

**n** represents the number of nodes in the linked list.

The Big O of ***space*** for **Includes** would be **O(1)**.

This is because there is no additional space being used than what is already given to us with the linked list input.

_____

## Adding a Node

* Make new node
* Set value on the new node
* Next for new node is the old head
* Make new head is now the new node
* Make new node point to the rest of the list

**Time**: O(1) ‚ú¶ **Space**: O(1)
