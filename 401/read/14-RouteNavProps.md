## Routing within MVC

ASP.NET MVC routing is a system responsible for mapping browser requests to specified MVC controller actions.

ASP.NET MVC routes are responsible for determining which controller method to execute for a given URL.

## Routing within Core

### **Routing is a "pattern matching system" that monitors the incoming request and figures out what to do with that request.**

Endpoints are the app's units of executable request-handling code.

Endpoints are defined in the app and configured when the app starts.

> An **endpoint** is something that can be:
>
> * Selected, by matching the URL and HTTP method
>
> * Executed by running the delegate.

In an ASP.NET Core MVC application, you can define routes in two ways:

* Convention-Based Routing
* Attribute-Based Routing
