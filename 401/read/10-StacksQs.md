## Implementation: Stacks & Queues

### What is a Stack

A **stack** is a data structure that consists of **Nodes**.

Each **Node** references the next Node in the stack, ***but does not reference its previous***.

Common Terminology:

* **Push**: Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
* **Pop**: Nodes removed from the stack are *popped*. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
* **Top**: This is the *top of the stack*.
* **Peek**: When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
* **IsEmpty**: Returns true when stack is empty, otherwise returns false.
