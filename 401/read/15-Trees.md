[Computational Fairytales - Trees](http://computationaltales.blogspot.com/2011/05/binary-search-trees-and-speck-spider.html)

## Binary Trees

> Binary Trees restrict the number of children per node to two. Left and Right. There is no specific sorting order for a binary tree. Nodes can be added into a binary tree wherever space allows.

## Binary Search Trees

> In Binary Search Trees, Nodes are organized where all values that are smaller than the **root**, are placed to the left, and all larger values are placed to the right.

## K-ary Trees

> If Nodes are allowed to have more than two children nodes, the tree that contains them is called a **K-ary Tree**. We use K to refer to the maximum number of children that each Node is able to have.

## Terminology

* **Node** - A Tree node is a component which may contain it’s own values, and references to other nodes
* **Root** - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
* **K** - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
* **Left** - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
* **Right** - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
* **Edge** - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
* **Leaf** - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
* **Height** - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

## Traversing Trees

There are two categories of traversals when it comes to Trees:

* Depth First
* Breadth First

### Depth First

"**Depth First**" traversal is when we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first.

### Breadth First
