### Binary Trees

### Binary Search Trees

### K-arty Trees

## Terminology

* Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain it’s own values, and references to other nodes
* Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
* K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
* Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
* Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
* Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
* Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
* Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

## Traversing Trees

There are two categories of traversals when it comes to Trees:

* Depth First
* Breadth First

### Depth First

"**Depth First**" traversal is when we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first.

### Breadth First
