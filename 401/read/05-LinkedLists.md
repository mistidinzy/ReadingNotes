## Linked Lists

[Computational Fairytales - Linked Lists](https://bit.ly/3DldRYE)

(***Left:*** Array **-** ***Right:*** Linked List)

A linked list is a different way to store a sequence of values.

**Nodes**, which are linked together. Each node reference the next node in the link.

(***Like putting a fire out with a Bucket Line***.)

When the linked list reaches the end, the value will return *null*.

There are two types of Linked List.

### Singly

&

### Doubly

_____

**Linked List**: A data structure that contains nodes that link/point to the next node in the list.

**Singly**: The number of references that the node has. There is only one reference, and it points to the **next** node in the list.

**Doubly**: The Node references two other nodes. Like a playlist, can go backward or forward.

**Node**: Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.

**Next**: Each Node has a property called **Next**. This property contains the reference to the next node.

**Head**: Always the first Node in the list.

**Current**: Current is the reference of type Node to the node that is currently being looked at. When moving through the list, you create a new Current variable at the Head to guarantee that you are starting from the beginning of the linked list.
