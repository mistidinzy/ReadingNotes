## The Basics of MVC Architecture

MVC is a **design pattern/architecture**, and helps in developing the web app in an efficient way when compared with the traditional ASP dotNET Web app.

MVC separates the design of the application into three layers: Model, View and Controller.

ASP dotNET MVC is useful when developing lightweight applications with a large team, since a few developers can work on different layers.

---

### **Model**

Represents the objects in the application.

Model is also a class which has all the objects, properties and methods defined in it.

### **View**

Contains all the HTML controls that define the UI of the app.

### **Controller**

Handles requests from the user and returns a response.

A Controller is a class with a group of methods called actions.

The controller maps the incoming request to the appropriate actions using a process called **Routing**.
