## Lessons in Problem Solving

Problem solving is a meta-skill.

The best way to solve problems involves having a framework and practicing it.

What are the steps you should take when you encounter a problem?

## 1. Understand

Know what is being asked. When you are able to explain what the problem is in plain English, then you understand the problem.

Try to write it out. Doodle it. Talk it through to someone else, or a rubber duck.

## 2. Plan

Write down the exact steps and plan your solution.

Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.

## 3. Divide

Pay attention.

Break it up into sub-problems.

Begin with the simplest.

Connect the dots between your sub-solutions.

### Stuck?

Take a deep breath. The best programmers view bugs/errors with curiousity.
