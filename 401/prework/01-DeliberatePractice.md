## What is Deliberate Practice

Deliberate practice is the most effective method for rapidly improving any skill.

It consists of intense, structured practice on essential aspects of the task you are trying to master.

_____

### Characteristics of Deliberate Practice

* Takes place outside of your comfort zone. Requires an open mindset, willing to try things beyond your current abilities.

* Involves well-defined, smart goals and often involves improving a specific aspect of the target skill. Rather than aimed at overall improvement.

* Requires your full, undivided attention. You must concentrate on the specific goal of the practice and make conscience adjustments to try to achieve it.

* Involves feedback, and then modifications of efforts in response to that feedback. As you progress, you should begin to monitor yourself, spot mistakes and adjust accordingly.

* Involves building or modifying some previously acquired skill, by focusing on particular aspects of those, and working on improving a specific part.

### Criteria of Deliberate Practice

1. Must be motivated to prioritize the task and exert true effort to improve your performance.

2. You should take into account your current knowledge of the task, so that it can be correctly understood after a brief period of instruction. The activities should be at an appropriate, challenging level of difficulty.

3. You should receive immediate, informative feedback and knowledge of the results of your performance.

4. You should repeatedly perform the same or similar tasks.

### Your speed of progress depends mainly on the quality and intensity of each practice session, multiplied by the length of time you practice

_____

## Designing Deliberate Practice

1. Identify experts in your desired skill/field.
2. Try to figure out what they do that makes them so good.
3. Design purposeful practice centered around learning to do that yourself.

***Focus. Feedback. Fix it.***

Break the skill down into components that you can do repeatedly and analyze effectively, determine your weaknesses, and find out how to improve them.

### Ask yourself questions

#### Before Practice

* How can I improve?
* What exercises will help me learn this skill?
* Who can I look to learn from?
* Can I invent my own exercises that address what I hope to achieve?
* Is there a better way to do this?

#### During Practice

* How am I doing?
* What adjustments do I need to make?
* Am I fully focused?

#### After Practice

* What went well?
* What didn't go so well?
* How can I improve for next time?
* Was the exercise too easy or too hard?
* How can it be adjusted?
* What changes can I make to keep developing further?

### Recap

* Deliberate Practice is the most effective way to improve any skill.
* It involves activities designed to improve specific areas of your performance of a skill.
* It requires your full attention, motivation, feedback on how you're doing, high effort, and many repetitions.
* Deliberate Practice is difficult. It's not alway easy to fulfill all of the criteria.
* The closer you can get to implementing Deliberate Practice in your learning, the faster you will improve.
* High level performers demonstrate ways we can all look to for ways that we can improve our own practice. Use them as inspiration for how you can grow faster.
