## Carol Dweck: "The Power of Believing You Can Improve"

## How to Encourage the Growth Mindset

### Praise Wisely

Not just praising intelligence, or talent.

### Praise the Process

The effort, strategies, focus, perseverence, and improvement.

When a growth mindset is fostered, the meaning of effort and difficulty are transformed.

  > *Let's not waste any more lives. Because once we know that abilities are capable of such growth, it becomes a ***basic human right*** for children, all children, to live in places that create that growth, to live in places filled with ***"yet".*** - Carol Dweck*

## Angela Lee Duckworth: "Grit: The Power of Passion and Perserverence"

> *Grit is living life as a marathon, not a sprint.*

Grit is passion and perseverence for very long-term goals.

Grit is having stamina. Sticking with the plan for your future, day in & day out. Working really hard to make that future a reality.

Talent doesn't make you gritty. The closest you can get to building grit is by feeding that Growth Mindset.

> *People are much more likely to persevere when they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.*

## Alain de Botton: "A Kinder, Gentler Philosophy of Success"

[TedTalk Here](https://bit.ly/3zKsvGU)

> *A snob is anybody who takes a small part of you, and uses that to come to a complete vision of who you are. That is snobbery.*

Our whole lives, we have been told that we can achieve anything. Never before have expectations been so high about what a human can achieve within their lifetime. It's made to feel that as long as you have energy and a few bright ideas, you could start a major thing, much the same as Bill Gates.

We are the first society to be living in a world where we don't worship anything other than ourselves. We live in a time when we have put people on the Moon. So we tend to worship ourselves. Our heroes are human heroes.

We all think we know what success means. And a lot of the time, these ideas are not our own. They're developed over time by outside influences, often our parents. And then television, advertising, etc.

You can't be successful at everything. You can't have it all. Real vision of success has to admit what it's losing out on and accept it.

> *We should not give up on our ideas of success. We should make sure that they are truly our own. Make sure we are the authors of our ambitions.*
