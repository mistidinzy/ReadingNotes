[What is .NET](https://bit.ly/3B4MGAB)

.NET is a platform on which you can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries in order to build many different kinds of applications.

.NET is open source and managed under the .NET Foundation, which is an independent organization, whose goal is to foster open development centered around the ".NET ecosystem".

.NET apps can be written in C#, F# or Visual Basic.

.NET *Core* is a cross-platform .NET implementation, for websites, servers, and console apps on MacOS, Windows, and Linux.

NuGet is a package manager specifically built for .NET, which contains over 90,000 packages.

[What is Managed Code](https://bit.ly/3osfNKJ)

"Managed Code" is code whose execution is being managed by a *runtime*.

A runtime is the environment used for running programs during their production, testing, etc.

The runtime used for executing .NET programs is called the *CLR*.

[What is the CLR](https://bit.ly/2Y8A3pK)

The CLR or ***Common Language Runtime*** is the virtual machine component of the Microsoft .NET Framework.

It provides services such as memory management, type safety, exception handling, garbage collection, security and thread management.

All programs written for .NET are executed by the CLR, regardless of which programming language they are written in.
