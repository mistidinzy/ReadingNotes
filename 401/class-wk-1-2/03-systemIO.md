### Writing a file

    string myInfo = "I want to write all of this to a file";
    File.WriteAllText("/path/to/file.txt", myInfo);
    
    string[] myArray = new string[2];
    myArray[0] = "My first line of information";
    myArray[1] = "My second line of information";
    File.WriteAllText("/path/to/file.txt",myArray);

### Reading a file

    string[] myFile = File.ReadAllLines("/path/to/file.txt");
    string myFile = File.ReadAllText("/path/to/file.txt");
