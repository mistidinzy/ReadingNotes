## Takeaways

**Thing I am proud of**.

Not giving up!

Not being afraid to ask for a re-do.

Plus I was proud of the "content" in my slideshow.

I've usually found it difficult to write things like resumes, strengths/weaknesses, work history, etc. in a way that I was proud of.

But I was really happy with how my slideshow and the info on it turned out.

**One way to improve**.

Taking deeper breaths.

Slowing down before I start talking instead of in the middle of speaking.

I rewatched the presentation and immediately realized why it seemed so hard, even though in my head I was looking forward to it.

I mean yes, it was obvious that I was nervous, of course.

BUT, more than that, I was literally physically losing my breath the whole time.

Projecting my voice with asthma and only one working nostril (septum is completely deviated over) was a ***task and a half*** on its own.

So that effect was immediately clear to me as soon as I watched/listened to myself on the video.

**What resonated the most as a spectator**.

I really loved the reinforcement of how we really do each bring unique and valuable to our team.

It (seriously) brought the Captain Planet team rings thing to mind for me.

**What made you feel connected to the presenter**.

I always enjoy seeing pictures and hearing about everyone's real-world lives outside of our code bubble!

I personally feel like this whole experience has been something we've bonded through, so it would be harder ***not*** to feel connected and supportive!
