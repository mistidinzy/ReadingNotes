Reflect on what you learned today.

Submit three tips in each category below that you picked up today.

What advice do you want to give to your future self about:

## Offer and Negotiations?

**1.** Have confidence in the skills we have learned and the projects we have built. Don't sell yourself short.

**2.** Reflect on which factors/benefits you are willing to be flexible on versus which ones would be dealbreakers.

**3.** If you receive an offer, don't necessarily just accept it as-is. Reach out to support network for insight and possible direction towards negotiating further.

_____

## Targeted job search?

**1.** Make sure resume has relevant keywords in order to improve matching with Applicant Tracking System.

**2.** Value Proposition: Research what you can bring to the position.

**3.** Add even more specifics about DeltaV experience to resume.

_____

## Networking?

**1.** Build meaningful connections through common passions, (such as volunteer work).

**2.** Follow other outlets such as a company newsletter or blog, create news alerts, etc. to stay informed about the employer, and learn more about the company culture, if you'd be interested in pursuing a position there, etc.

**3.** Don't seek to build connections solely on what you can gain, but also genuinely consider what you can give.
