**1. What motivates me to get up
in the morning?**

> Becoming a better version of myself from the day before, both professionally and personally.

**2. What keeps me up at night?**

> Thinking about all of the problems all around us that could be helped:
>
> * Homelessness
>
> * Animal Welfare
>
> * Environmental Crises & Disasters
>
> * Hunger

**3. What am I doing when I’m
at my best?**

> * Volunteering
> * Delegating
> * When what I'm doing is helping family, friends, neighbors, etc.

**4. Why am I bothered by what
bothers me?**

> Because these things could be improved.
>
> We have the numbers, the technology, the resources, etc. to actually make a difference, but too many people feel like there's nothing they can do to help.

**5. Why do I do the work I do?**

> Not sure about how to answer this one.

**6. Why do I live where I live?**

> I was born here and my family is all here.
>
> Cost of living is lower here than a lot of other places.
>
> I was able to purchase my first home at 20 years old and build equity in it for 4 years.
>
> Dakota and I then used that, plus help from the Cedar Rapids *ROOTs* Program to get into a brand new home. I don't believe we would have had that opportunity somewhere else.
>
> Cedar Rapids really wouldn't be my top choice, but overall, I'm still proud of the things this community has been through and the people that are here.

**7. Why do I buy what I buy?**

> *We vote with our dollars.*

**8. Why do I long for what I long for?**

> The ongoing theme behind all of my wants throughout my life has been ***safety and stability***.
>
> Nearly all of the things that I long for, would have some positive affect on stability in my life or others'.
>
> I want to be in control of where I lay my head at night. And my safety, health, comfort, etc. each day.

**9. Why do I read and watch what I do?**

> To explore, to learn, to live vicariously.
>
> To experience worlds and adventures that I wouldn't be able to otherwise.
>
> To distract myself, to laugh, to have background noise.

**10. Why do I admire whom I admire?**

> Because I have seen them display some kind of determination, perseverance, creativity, passion, kindness, etc.

**11. When am I happy?**

> When I'm with my family on a breezy summer day.
>
> Taking care of my pets, and helping rescue animals.
>
> Rainy days when I get to squirrel away into my reading corner, with a book and no deadlines.

**12. Why do I have the relationships
that I have?**

> Because the relationships that I have bring peace, happiness, growth, support, love and laughter to my life.
