Identity is the ability to add Authentication and Authorization to your web application. This includes registrations, logins, restricted access to specific members, and authentication through Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc...

ASP.NET Core Identity was created to help with the security and management of users. It provides this abstraction layer between the application and the users/role data. We can use the API in it's entirety, or just bits and pieces as we need (such as the salting/hashing by itself) or email services. There is a lot of flexibility within ASP.NET Core Identity. We have the ability to take or leave whatever we want. Identity combines well with EFCore and SQL Server.
