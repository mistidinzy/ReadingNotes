          I‚Äôm still unsure of my goals. I started working when I was 14, and it feels like that‚Äôs all there has been. Work.

          I grew up glued to PBS, so I can't say I haven't been encouraged to "follow my dreams" and "be myself".
        </p>

        <p>
          But real life doesn‚Äôt always follow the motivational poster plan.

        <p>
          This is the first time in my life where I‚Äôve been able to make career decisions that are motivated by my passions.
        </p> 

        <!-- <p> Rather than necessity and survival. </p> -->

        <p> My interests, my dreams. The things that keep me up at night. </p>

        <p>So the waters are new, and I wouldn‚Äôt say that I know myself half as well as I should.</p>
        
        <p>Somethings I know are that I over-think. I want to understand everything. </p>
          
        <p></p>I want to help and I want to fix things.</p>

        <p>We have such a seemingly unending bounty of unique tech, and it‚Äôs always growing.</p>

        <p>Sometimes it feels like there couldn‚Äôt possibly be anything more to contribute.</p>
        
        <p>And yet, at some point each day, I always think: </p>

        <p> ‚ÄúThis would be (better, easier, faster, more accessible, etc.)
        if‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>

          My name is Misti Dinzy. I was born and raised here in Cedar Rapids. My passions are art, reading and volunteering‚Äîparticularly in Animal Rescue.I live with my fianc√©, Dakota. We have two dogs, two cats and a chinchilla.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> 
          I previously worked in Fraud Prevention and Quality Assurance.¬†I was really happy with the work that I was doing,¬†but like many others, the Covid-19 Pandemic really forced me to step back, and think about whether or not the environment that I was working in was right for me.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          As much as I loved doing what I was doing, I wanted to work for a company that valued me as an individual and cared about my safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so I decided to take this time to try to upskill, and actually pursue something that would be more aligned with my values and passions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I was working with Iowa Vocational Rehab, who helps Iowans with disabilities find and retain meaningful employment, which can sometimes be through advancing their education.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Because of my nature to over-analyze and try to solve problems around me‚ÄîPaula, my VR counselor suggested that I might want to do something in a STEM field, computer science or software development.
          We came down to either a Web Technologies certificate with Kirkwood, or DeltaV Code School.¬†
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I chose DeltaV because of the association with NewBoCo, because I was drawn to the fact that it was a non-profit, and so involved with the community.¬†
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          As that is something I have been very passionate about, I thought that I could come to DeltaV and get the technical skills to gain a career in software development,¬†but while also gaining some insight on how I can actually give back, and apply those skills in a way that matters to me.
