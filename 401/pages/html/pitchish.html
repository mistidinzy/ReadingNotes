      <h1>Hello.</h1>

      <p>My name is Misti Dinzy.</p>

        <p>I’m 29 years old. I have a background in Fraud Prevention and Quality Assurance.</p>
      
        <p>I’m still unsure of my goals. I started working when I was 14, and it feels like that’s all there has been. Work.</p>

        <p>I grew up glued to PBS, so I can't say I haven't been encouraged to "follow my dreams" and "be myself".</p>

        <p>But real life doesn’t always follow the motivational poster plan.</p>

        <br>

        <p>This is the first time in my life where I’ve been able to make career decisions that are motivated by my passions.</p> 

        <!-- <p>Rather than necessity and urgency.</p> -->

        <p>My interests, my dreams. The things that keep me up at night.</p>

        <p>So the waters are new, and I wouldn’t say that I know myself half as well as I should.</p>
        
        <p>Somethings I know are that I over-think. I want to understand everything. </p>
          
        <p></p>I want to help and I want to fix things.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>We have such a seemingly unending bounty of unique tech, and it’s always growing.</p>

        <p>Sometimes it feels like there couldn’t possibly be anything more to contribute.</p>
        
        <p>And yet, at some point each day, I always think, </p>

        <p> “This would be (better, easier, faster, more accessible, etc.)
        if…”</p>

        <!-- <p>I don’t think we could ever be “finished” improving the world around us.</p> -->
