## How to Encourage the Growth Mindset

### Praise Wisely

Not just praising intelligence, or talent.

### Praise the Process

The effort, strategies, focus, perserverence, and improvement.

When a growth mindset is fostered, the meaning of effort and difficulty are transformed.

  > *Let's not waste any more lives. Because once we know that abilities are capable of such growth, it becomes a ***basic human right*** for children, all children, to live in places that create that growth, to live in places filled with ***"yet".*** - Carol Dweck*
