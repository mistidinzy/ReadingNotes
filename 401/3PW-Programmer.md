## Lessons in Problem Solving

Problem solving is a meta-skill.

The best way to solve problems involves having a framework and practicing it.

## 1. Understand

Know what is being asked. When you are able to explain what the problem is in plain English, then you understand the problem.

## 2. Plan



## 3. Divide
