# Functions
    Functions are a series of statements that form a specific task when together. 

    First, you need to declare the function using the keyword **function**. 
    Second, identify the function with a name of your choice, followed by paranthesis. 
    (Sometimes there may be further information within these paranthesis. These are called parameters.)

    Now you've declared your function and given it the instructions it needs. 
    In order to make the function work, you have to call it. Calling the function tells the script it's time to perform the task. 
    To call a function, just write the function's name followed by paranthesis. 

        function **hello**()
