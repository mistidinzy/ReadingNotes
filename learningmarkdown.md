# Learning Markdown

Let's start with GitHub.

**GitHub** is a website that we can use to store and share the code we've written for our projects. 
It's kind of like a storage locker that you can choose to share the key to. 
Whoever you share the key with would then be able to see the contents and change them if they'd like, or add their own code as well. 

**Markdown** is one variety within a group of programming languages known as lightweight markup language \(LML). It can be used for a lot of things in a lot of different places.   

But in GitHub, we create **Markdown files** \(the ones that end in .md) to change the way this \"storage locker" and its contents are presented. 
We can add headers, lists, tables, make the font *italic* or **bold**, etc. to make it easier to navigate, or just better to look at. 

As any language, Markdown is composed of words and symbols that come together to form a sentence.   This choreography of specific words and symbols, coming together to form a language, is known as its \"syntax". 

> **Syntax**: A set of rules that govern how words are combined to form longer strings of meaning.
