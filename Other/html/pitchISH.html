  <p>My name is Misti Dinzy. I’m 29 years old. I have a background in Fraud Prevention and Quality Assurance.</p>

  <p>I’m still unsure of my goals. I started working when I was 14, and it feels like that’s all there has been.</p>

  <p><em>Work.</em></p>

  <p>I grew up glued to PBS, so you can't say I haven't been encouraged to <em>follow my dreams</em> and

  <p>This is the first time in my life where I’ve been able to make <strong>career</strong> decisions, based
  around my passions, my interests, my dreams.</p>

  <p>We have such a seemingly unending bounty of unique tech, and it’s always growing. Sometime it feels like there
    couldn’t possibly be anything more to contribute.</p>
  <p>And yet, at some point each day, I always think, “This would be (better, easier, faster, more accessible, etc.)
    if…”</p>
  <p>I don’t think we could ever be “finished” improving the world around us, because it’s not</p>
