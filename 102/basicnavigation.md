### Paths

> **Paths** are a way to move to a specific file or directory. <br>
> There are two types of paths. Absolute and Relative.
> * Absolute - File/Directory in relation to the root of the file system; Starts with a forward slash (/).
> * Relative - File/Directory in relation to where we are currently; Does not start with anything.

### Path Shortcuts

> * **. (dot)** - reference to your current directory
> * **.. (dotdot)** -  reference to the parent directory
> * Use the command **cd**, without any arguments, to go back to your home directory
