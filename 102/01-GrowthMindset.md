## What does *Growth Mindset* mean to you?

A growth mindset is the ability \(and the willingness) to view situations in a constructive way.

When you are in a growth mindset, you use challenges and obstacles as opportunities to improve.

Growth mindset is like a muscle, it requires ongoing maintenance and practice in order to avoid falling into a fixed mindset.

## How can you help yourself get into a growth mindset and stay there?

**1. Practice self-awareness. Be critical of yourself. Record everything!**

- What do you want to be proud of? What are you not so proud of?
- What worked? What didn't?
- What else can I try? Set SMART goals.

**2. Limit distractions and temptations to avoid the problem. Don't give into instant gratification!**

- Set time limits on breaks. Set yourself up for success with your environment.
- Reward true growth, not avoidance.

**3. Utilize resources!**

- Ask peers & instructors for help and criticism.
- Keep a collection of things that help you stay on track. \(e.g., productivity/mindfullness blogs such as Atlassian)
- Always keep an eye out for new tools, techniques and inspiration.
