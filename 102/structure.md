# Structure Webpages with HTML

 ### HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language
 
  Uses markup elements to define content. 
   > Opening and Closing tags: Used to indicate where content within element begins and ends.
   > 
   > Self-Closing tags: Used when the element itself is the content. 
   > 
   > Attributes: Hidden extra information about the element.
   > 
   > Nesting: Elements within other elements. 


**HTML Example** 

  ``` html 
    <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
      <head>
       <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>My test page</title>
      </head>
    <body>
      <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">
    </body>
    </html>
  ```

 ### Wireframe - Rough draft of a web page interface. 
  
  Can be handdrawn or made using a software depending on designer's preference. 
  
  You will also want to create your "user flow",  to get an idea of how someone on your website will   be able to navigate on their own. 
  
  Get inspiration from resources such as:
   * [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/)
   * [Behance](https://www.behance.net/) 
 
 
 ### Semantics - What is the **meaning** of a piece of code.  
   
   Benefits from using correct semantics: 
   * Search engines use as important keywords to determine a page's search rankings
   * Screen readers use them to help visually impaired users navigate
   * Makes it easier to find meaningful blocks of code
  
  Questions to ask yourself about Semantics: 
   * What element will best describe the data that I'm going to include?
   * What purpose or effect will it have?
