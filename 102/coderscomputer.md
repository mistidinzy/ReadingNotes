## InstallFest

  Class Two is all about optimizing my computer for coding. I setup my Terminal and installed several programs to help me get started.
  
  **The Terminal I am using is called Windows Powershell ISE.**

  It is an "integrated scripting environment" within Windows that allows me to input code that will make changes on my computer.  

  **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux):**
  
  An add-on feature which allows me to use a Linux-based operating system, (such as Ubuntu) connected directly to my terminal.

  **Homebrew:**
  
  An add-on tool that makes it easier to install applications onto my computer, right from my terminal.
  
  **Node.js:** Used for building applications with JavaScript.
  
  [Here is a useful guide I found from the Node.js website](https://nodejs.dev/learn)<br>

  **NPM:** Another tool used for installing applications/Node.js packages.

  **Git:** This is a system that keeps track of all the changes that have been made to your code.<br>

  I configured Git to connect to my GitHub profile as well.
  
  **Tree:** An add-on I installed that lets me use the command 'tree', so that I can see my files in a tree format.
  
  **ESLint:** A tool used for analyzing my code to help me find and fix errors within that code.
  
  **VSCode:** A code editor made by Microsoft, loaded with helpful extensions I can install that make coding faster, easier, more accurate, etc.

### After InstallFest, I ran the following codes to verify that everything was setup correctly

* code --version
* git --version
* node --version
* npm --version
* eslint --version
* tree --version
* echo $PS1
* cat ~/.gitconfig
