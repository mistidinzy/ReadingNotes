# Coder's Computer

## InstallFest
  Class Two is all about optimizing my computer for coding. I setup my Terminal and installed several programs to help me get started.
  
  **The Terminal I am using is called Windows Powershell ISE.**
  It is an "integrated scripting environment" within Windows that allows me to input code that will make changes on my computer.  

  **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux):** An add-on feature which allows me to use a Linux-based operating system, (such as Ubuntu) connected directly to my terminal. 
      
  **Homebrew:** An add-on tool that makes it easier to install applications onto my computer, right from my terminal.
  
  **Node.js:** Used for building applications with JavaScript. [Here is a useful guide I found from the Node.js website](https://nodejs.dev/learn)<br> 
  **NPM:** Another tool used for installing applications/Node.js packages. 
    
  **Git:** This is a system that keeps track of all the changes that have been made to your code.<br>

  I configured Git to connect to my GitHub profile as well. 
  
  **Tree:** An add-on I installed that lets me use the command 'tree', so that I can see my files in a tree format. 
  
  **ESLint:** A tool used for analyzing my code to help me find and fix errors within that code. 
  
  **VSCode:** A code editor made by Microsoft, loaded with helpful extensions I can install that make coding faster, easier, more accurate, etc.

### After InstallFest, I ran the following codes to verify that everything was setup correctly:
```
code --version 
git --version 
node --version
npm --version
eslint --version
tree --version 
echo $PS1
cat ~/.gitconfig
```
