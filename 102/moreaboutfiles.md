# More About Files

### Naming Files 

_____

#### Linux files are case sensitive. 
> When referring to files in Linux, be aware of correct case usage. Important when writing commands in Linux, also. 
#### Be careful using spaces when naming. 
> If you use a space when naming a file or directory, be aware you will have to add quotes or an escape character to get your terminal to understand it is a single item. 
>
> You can use tab completion to automatically escape the spaces (if you use it before you get to the space)

_____

### Hidden Files & Directories 

> If a file begins with a . (dot), then it is a hidden file. <br>
> When creating a file you want to be hidden, just start the name with that dot. <br>
> You can also rename a file, remove the dot, if you no longer want it to be hidden. <br>
> List (**ls**) will not show hidden files automatically. You have to add the option **-a** to show hidden files in your list.
