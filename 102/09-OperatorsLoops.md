## Expressions and Operators

An **operator** performs some kind of action on a single or multiple data values (operands), and then produces a result.

    Example: 1 + 2 = 3

**+** is the **operator** in this example. 1 is the left side *operand*. 2 is the right side *operand*.

### Javascript has several types of **operators**

They are as follows:

- Assignment
- Comparison
- Arithmetic
- Bitwise
- Logical
- String
- Conditional (ternary)
- Comma
- Unary
- Relational

---

Javascript has both **binary** and **unary** operators, and one special **ternary** operator: the Conditional operator.

**Binary** operators require **two** operands. (Like the 1 and 2 in the above example.)

**Unary** operators only need **one** operand.

    Example: i++ or --1

---

### Assignment Operators

Assign a value to the left operand based on the value of the right operand.

    Example: 2 = 3 + x

Commonly used in mathematic formulas, but can also be used to assign objects to variables.

    Example: var obj = {};

---

### Comparison Operators

A **comparison operator** compares its operands, and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true.

    Example: 3 == var1

Equal (==)

Not Equal (!=)

Strict Equal (===)

Strict Not Equal (!==)

Greater Than (>)

Less Than (<)
