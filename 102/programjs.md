## Expressions

An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

Categories:

    - Arithmetic
    - String
    - Logical
    - Primary
    - Left-hand-side expressions

## Operators

Javascript has a ton of types of operators.

    - Assignment
    - Comparison
    - Arithmetic
    - Bitwise
    - Logical
    - String
    - Conditional
    - Comma

## Functions

Functions are a series of statements that form a specific task when together.

First, you need to declare the function using the keyword **function**.

Second, identify the function with a **name** of your choice, followed by paranthesis.

(Sometimes there may be further information within these paranthesis. These are called **parameters**.)

Now you've declared your function and given it the instructions it needs.

In order to make the function work, you have to **call** it. Calling the function tells the script it's time to perform the task.

To **call** a function, use the function's name followed by paranthesis.

That will look like this:

        function hello()
