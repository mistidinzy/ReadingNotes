# Functions

Functions are a series of statements that form a specific task when together. 

First, you need to declare the function using the keyword **function**. 

Second, identify the function with a **name** of your choice, followed by paranthesis. 

(Sometimes there may be further information within these paranthesis. These are called **parameters**.)

Now you've declared your function and given it the instructions it needs. 

In order to make the function work, you have to **call** it. Calling the function tells the script it's time to perform the task. 

To **call** a function, use the function's name followed by paranthesis. 

That will look like this:

        function **hello**()
