## SQL

SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases. **Structured Query Language** is a domain-specific language used for managing data held in a relational database management system. It can access many records with a single command. And it eliminates the need to specify *how* to reach a record.

## NoSQL

[nosql](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)

Five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

- SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed databases.

- SQL databases are table-based. NoSQL databases are document-based, key:value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.

- SQL dbs have pre-defined schemas. NoSQL dbs have dynamic schema.

- SQL dbs are vertically scalable. NoSQL dbs are horizontally scalable.

- SQL: structured query language(SQL) vs. NoSQL: unstructured query language(UnQL)

**What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**
    > Heavy-duty transactional-based applications. Complex queries.

**Give a real world example.**
    > MySQL Community Edition

**What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**
    > Large data sets.

**Give a real world example.**
    > MongoDB

**Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**
    > SQL dbs aren't good for hierarchical data storage, NoSQL dbs are a better fit.

**Which type of database is best for scalability?**
    > ? Unclear. They are scalable in different ways.
