[Functional Programming Concepts](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

1. What is functional programming?
    > Functional programming is a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs. This style treats computation as the evaluation of math functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. (Wikipedia)

2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
    > It returns the same result if given the same arguments.
    > It does not cause any observable side effects.

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
    > The code is easier to test.
4. What is immutability?
    > Unchanging over time, unable to be changed.
5. What is Referential transparency?
    > If a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, then it is referentially transparent.
