## **React is a component-based library, used to build user interfaces**

---

### 3 Fundamentals of React

- Components
- Props
- State

## Component-Based Architecture

**What is a component?**

### **Components are similar to functions, in that they are independent, reusable bits of code.**

---

**What are the charactistics of a component?**

- **Reusability**: Can be reused for different situations or designed for a specific use.

- **Replaceable**: Can be interchanged with other components.

- **Not context-specific**: Can be used in different environments.

- **Extensible**: Can be extended to provide a new behavior.

- **Encapsulated**: Data is enclosed within a class, which allows you to hide specific information and control access to the internal **state** of the object.

- **Independent**: Designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

---

**What are the advantages of using component based architecture?**

- Components are reusable and flexible.
- Easy to replace existing versions without impace on other components.
- Reduced cost.

### Things I want to know more about

  I would like to see this article translated into more layman's terms. The whole thing is pretty hard for me to follow in general.

  What is meant in the "Encapsulated" characteristic bullet point (in the reading).

## **What is Props & How to use it in React**

[What is Props & How to Use It](https://itnext.io/what-is-props-and-how-to-use-it-in-react-da307f500da0)

### **What is props short for?**

  Properties.

### **How are props used in React?**

  Props are used to pass data between components.

### **What is the flow of props?**

  Data is passed in a read-only, uni-directional flow.

  One way, from parent to child.
