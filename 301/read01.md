## Component Based Architecture

**What is a component?**

  Components are similar to functions, that create HTML elements. They are independent, reusable bits of code.

**What are the charactistics of a component?**
  
    * Reusability - Can be reused for different situations or designed for a specific use.

    * Replaceable - Can be interchanged with other components.

    * Not context-specific - Can be used in different environments.

    * Extensible - Can be extended to provide a new behavior.

    * Encapsulated - ?

    * Independent - Designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

**What are the advantages of using component based architecture?**

    * Components are reusable and flexible.
    * Easy to replace existing versions without impace on other components.
    * Reduced cost.

## Things I want to know more about

  I would like to see this article translated into more layman's terms. The whole thing is pretty hard for me to follow in general.

  What is meant in the "Encapsulated" characteristic bullet point.

  Properties.

**How are props used in React?**

  Props are used to pass data between components.
