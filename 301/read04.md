# React and Forms

[React Docs - Forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)

**What is a ‘Controlled Component’?**

> An input form element whose value is controlled by React. In React, the component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form upon user input.

**Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form?**

**OR**

**Should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them?**

> Update the state as soon as they enter their responses.

**Why?**

> So we can control what happens in the form, depending on what they put into it.

**How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?**

> Add a name attribute to each element and let the handler function choose what to do, based on the value of event.target.name

**Why would we use a ternary operator?**

> To simplify conditional expressions. Frequently used as a shortcut for the *if* statement.

**Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:**

   let ternary = (x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);)
