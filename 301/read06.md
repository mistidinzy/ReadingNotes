## Node.js

[An Introduction to Node.js](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/)

### **1. What is node.js?**

> Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. A result of Ryan Dahl taking the V8 Engine, and enhancing it with various features; Such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system-related utility methods.

### **2. What is Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine?**

> The open-source JacaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers. It is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

### **3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?**

> A "runtime" is an environment where your javascript code will be executed once you run it.

### **4. What is npm?**

> npm is an online repository for publishing open-source Node.js projects. It's also a command-line utility for interacting with that repository, that aid in package installation, version management, and dependency management.

### **5. What version of node are you running on your machine?**

> v16.7.0

### **6. What version of npm are you running on your machine?**

> 7.21.0

### **7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?**

> npm install -g jshint

### **8. What is node used for?**

> Running various build tools. Node and npm are designed to automate the process of developing a JavaScript application.

## Pair Programming

[6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

### **1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?**

> 1. Greater efficiency.
> 2. Engaged collaboration.
> 3. Learning from fellow students.
> 4. Social skills.
> 5. Job interview readiness.
> 6. Work environment readiness.

**Pair programming touches on all four fundamental programming skills.**

> 1. Speaking - Explaining out loud what the code should do.
> 2. Listening - Listen to each others' guidance.
> 3. Reading - Read code that others have written.
> 4. Writing - Write code themselves.

### **2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?**

*Learning from fellow students*
>When you work together in this way, you get a refresher on things that you might be fuzzy on, or have forgotten altogether. You get another view on the problems and what can be done to solve them.

*Social skills*
>Coming into this program as a pretty hardcore introvert, the idea of pair programming sounded pretty horrific to me. Now I look forward to it, because getting to know my peers has been really enjoyable. Plus, it has helped calm my nerves and validate my worries, because I usually find out that we're usually all having very similar feelings.

### **3. How does pair programming work?**

> Two programmers work together on a project, each tasked with a specific role.
>
> These two roles are the **Driver** and the **Navigator**.
>
> The **Driver** is the programmer doing the typing, and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. They manage the text editor, switching files, version control, and writing code.
>
> The **Navigator** verbally guides the Driver, but doesn't touch the keyboard themselves at all. They scan the code for typos or bugs, while thinking about the big picture of the project, and what comes next.

### The ***async*** Keyword

> An ***async*** function is a function that knows how to expect the possibility of the ***await*** keyword being used to invoke asynchronous code. 

[Asynchronous?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Concepts#asynchronous)

> The ***await*** keyword can be put in front of an async function, to pause your code on that line until a ***promise*** is returned by the function.

[Promises?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Promises)

> A promise-based function allows you to defer further actions until after a previous action has completed, or respond to its failure. A Promise represents an intermediate state of an operation; A promise that some kind of result will be returned, at some point in the future.
