# The Command Line

_____

The Command Line aka Terminal, is a text-based interface. You can type in **commands** to control this terminal, and the system will give you output/feedback as text in return. 

> A ***command*** is a sequence of words, separated by spaces/blanks, that tells the terminal what to do. The first word specifies the command to be executed. Everything that follows the first word of the command is called an **Argument**.
 
## Arguments 

> Arguments are the file names or data given to the command to further specify what to do. <br>
It's kind of like the command is saying "do this", and the arguments are saying "here's how". 

## Options 

> One kind of argument is an **Option**. <br>
> An *option* is a single letter code that modifies the behavior of the command. <br>
> Options are typically defined by beginning with a hyphen (-). <br>
>
> Example: <br>
>    "**-l**" is an option that commonly means 'long', "**-v**" is another option that means 'verbose'. <br>
>  Together, "**-lv**" are *two* options combined to make a *single* argument.
