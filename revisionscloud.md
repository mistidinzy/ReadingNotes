 * Click the green "Code" box.
 * Under the "clone" section, find your repo's URL and copy it.
 * Open your terminal and navigate to the directory (folder) where you'd like to store your clone.
   > cd deltavcode102
 * Use command git clone + your URL here.
   > $ git clone https://github.com/test
   
Done!
