## Cloning GitHub Repository
   Cloning your GitHub repo allows you to save a local copy of your repository onto your computer. 
   You can then make changes to this copy and feed those through to your remote copy later. 
 
 
### To clone a Repo from GitHub to your computer:  
 * Go to your Repo's page on GitHub.
 * Click the green "Code" box.
 * Under the "clone" section, find your repo's URL and copy it.
 * Open your terminal and navigate to the directory (folder) where you'd like to store your clone.
   > cd deltavcode102
 * Use command git clone + your URL here.
   > $ git clone https://github.com/test
   
Done! 

Now you can: 
 > use **cd *yourreponame*** to move to your repo's directory. 

Open VS Code with **code .** and make changes to your files there.

## **Important:** Once you're done making changes to your files, you have to **ACP!**

# ⭐Add - Commit - Push ⭐ 

### **Note:** 
 > Using **git status** before ACP is a very very good practice, as it shows you all the changes you have made since your last commit.  


## 1. Add - Add your changes to be saved. This "stages" the file(s).
 
 Add file individually 
  > git add *filenamehere* <br>
  
 or 
 
 Add all files
 > git add *

## 2. Commit - Commit changes.

Include **-m** + notes explaining the changes you are making 
 > git commit -m *updated filename*

## 3. Push - Push changes through to GitHub.
 > git push origin master
