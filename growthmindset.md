# Growth Mindset

## What does *Growth Mindset* mean to you? 
A growth mindset is the ability \(and the willingness) to view situations in a constructive way. 

When you are in a growth mindset, you use challenges and obstacles as opportunities to improve. 

Growth mindset is like a muscle, it requires ongoing maintenance and practice in order to avoid falling into a fixed mindset. 

## How can you help yourself get into a growth mindset and stay there? 
**1. Practice self-awareness, be critical of yourself. Record everything!**
  - What do you want to be proud of? What are you not so proud of? 
  - What worked? What didn't?
  - What else can I try? Set SMART goals. 
  
**2. Limit distractions and temptations to avoid the problem. Don't give into instant gratification!**
  - Set time limits on breaks. Set yourself up for success with your environment. 
  - Reward true growth, not avoidance. 
  
**3. Utilize resources!** 
  - Ask peers & instructors for help and criticism. 
  - Keep a collection of things that help you stay on track. \(e.g., productivity/mindfullness blogs such as Atlassian)  
  - Always keep an eye out for new tools, techniques and inspiration.
