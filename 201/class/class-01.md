## HTML

Chapter One - Structure

HTML describes the structure of a web page. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is made up of *elements* that live inside angled brackets. They begin with an *opening tag* and usually end with a *closing tag*. These elements tell the web browser what kind of information it is reading between those tags.

``` html
        <header>This is where I could put a heading</header>
```

In this example, the header tag tells the web browser that "This is where I could put a heading" is going to be a header. This helps it know where to put it and how to treat it within the structure.
