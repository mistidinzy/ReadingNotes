### Chapter One - Structure

HTML describes the structure of a web page. HTML is made up of ***elements*** that live inside angled bracket containers. They begin with an ***opening tag*** and usually end with a ***closing tag***.  Elements tell the web browser what kind of information it is reading between those tags.

``` html
    <header>This is where I could put a heading</header>
```

In this example, the header tag tells the web browser that "This is where I could put a heading" is going to be a header. This helps it know where to put it and how to treat it within the structure.

```html
    <p lang="en-us">Paragraph in English</p>
```

Sometimes there are ***Attributes*** in the opening tags as well.  
Attributes give even more information about what kind of contents we're looking at.
In this example, the attribute is 'lang'. This tells us what language the content is going to be.
And "en-us" tells us that the language is going to be English. This is the ***attribute value.***

HTML structure is usually made up of the same basic handful of elements to start off with. You can usually expect to see these ones at the very least:

```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head></head>
        <body>
            <main></main>
            <footer></footer>
        </body>
    </html>
```
