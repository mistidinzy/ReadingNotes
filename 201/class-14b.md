[Google: *Project Aristotle*](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/28/what-google-learned-in-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

In 2021, Google wanted to discover how to build the "perfect team", so they embarked on a quest named Project Aristotle.

They spent years analyzing data from over 180 teams across the company. They found that there were five key characteristics of the best teams.

> 1. **Psychological Safety:** Everyone on the team feels safe around their team members, and empowered to take risks and speak their minds, without fear of embarrassment or punishment.
> 2. **Dependability:** Everyone completes quality work, on time.
> 3. **Structure & Clarity:** Everyone knows what their specific expectations are. Expectations are challenging, yet attainable.
> 4. **Meaning:** Everyone has a sense of purpose in their work (financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, etc.).
> 5. **Impact:** Everyone sees that the result fo their work actually contributes to their team's overall goals.
