# Class Six - JavaScript Object Literals & The DOM

## Objects

Objects group together a set of variables and functions. They create a model used to represent something from the world around you.
Within an object, **variables** become *properties*, and **functions** become *methods*.
There are several ways to create objects.
The easiest and most popular way to create objects is **literal notation**.
You can access the properties or methods of an object using **dot notation**.

Browsers come with three sets of built-in objects.

- Browser Object Model
- Document Object Model
- Global JavaScript Model

### Document Object Model

When a browser loads a webpage, it creates a model of the page in memory.
The Document Object Model specifies how the browswer should structure that model.

The browser represents the webpage using a DOM tree.
DOM trees have four types of nodes. Document, Element, Attribute, and Text Nodes.
Each node is an object with methods and properties.

### Problem Domain

The hardest part of programming is finding the "problem domain".
In order to solve a problem, you have to know what the problem is, first.
