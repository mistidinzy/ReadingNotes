# Hello

## About Me 
**My name is Misti.** I'm 28 years old, born and raised in Cedar Rapids, IA. I'm currently a student, exploring opportunities to find my \"niche" in the world. 
My passions are in animal rescue, all forms of art, organization and yoga. Before becoming a student, I was a Quality Assurance auditor for the last six years. So I have a knack for efficient, accurate data entry and a quick eye for detail. I'm excited to exist at the same time as this ever-changing digital world, where we can reach others all over the world and create great things together. Nice to meet you! ‚òÄÔ∏è
