# Hello!

## About Me 
**My name is Misti Dawn Dinzy.** I'm 28 years old, born and raised in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.   
I'm currently a student, exploring opportunities to find my \"niche" in the world.   
My passions are in animal rescue, all forms of art, organization, reading and yoga.  
I'm very excited and grateful to exist at the same time as this ever-changing digital world, where we can reach others all over the world and create great things together.   
It's nice to meet you! ☀️
